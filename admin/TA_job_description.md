## Teaching Assistant Job Description

Teaching assistants for the Data Science Clinic are entrusted with both direct student contact as well as assisting on specific projects. Over the course of the quarter, the TA will work closely with the mentor and clinic administration to ensure the success of their teams' projects.

Duties include:

* Leading bi-weekly in-person working sessions
* Answering questions via Slack and e-mail
* Reviewing code
* Taking attendance 
* Assisting in additional grading 

TAs are assigned to two projects each quarter. On each project, the TA will be required to run two weekly in-person work sessions and attend one weekly mentor meeting. At each work session, the TA will be required to take attendance and answer any additional questions the students have. All meetings are scheduled during the first week of class in accordance with the team's schedule and are held on the Hyde Park campus of the University of Chicago.

The TA will also be required to assist in additional grading during the last week of the quarter. Specifically there are technical hurdles that each project is required to complete by the end of the quarter. TAs are provided a short checklist to verify that those hurdles have been met.

### Requirements

TAs are expected to have a knowledge of Python, data science techniques and Git/Github. We do our best to match TAs to projects that align best with their previous experiences, though we do expect TAs to be able to come up to speed on additional tools and technologies as required.

### Expected Hours

This is an _in person_ position during the school year. If you are planning on traveling or unable to be on campus during the entire quarter (including reading period) please consider alternative positions.

TAs are expected to work 10 hours per week during all weeks of the quarter including reading period and final weeks.

### Compensation

Total compensation is $4,500 per course.
