If you want to display things from the DSI cluster on your local machine (ie open images, run a program that requires a GUI, etc.) you will need to set up X11 forwarding.

1. First, you will need to update your `~/.ssh/config` file. Assuming you have followed the previous instructions for setting up your `config` file, you should have something like this:

```
Host fe.ds*
  HostName fe01.ds.uchicago.edu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/PRIVATE_KEY
  ForwardAgent yes
  User CNET_ID
  # add the below lines for X11 forwarding
  ForwardX11 yes  # for flag -X
  ForwardX11Trusted yes # for flag -Y, not necessary
  ```
2. Log in to the cluster using `ssh fe.ds`
3. Request a compute node (you don't need a GPU) - something like this will work:
`srun -p general -t 6:00:00 --mem=8GB --pty /bin/bash`
4. Sign into your compute node in a new terminal window with the `-X` flag. So, if you are assigned node `i001`, your command will be:
`ssh -X i001.ds`
5. To check that you have X11 forwarding working, run:
`echo $DISPLAY`
You should get something like:
`localhost:10.0`
6. You may also need to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) on your local machine
7. To view an image, use Eye of GNOME:
`eog /path/to/img.jpeg`
