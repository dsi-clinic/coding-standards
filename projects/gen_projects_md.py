### Previous Projects

This page contains a list of projects organized by quarter with the list of \
students who worked on the project and the faculty mentor. Note that the \
dates listed below are by _calendar year_ not academic year.

A few important notes:
* Not all projects have complete information. Some of the projects are under \
NDAs or other specifications (such as UChicago not hosting the repo).
* The requirements for the project have changed year over year and are \
sometimes project specific.
* Projects designated by a "&#8224;" were funded by <!-- \
markdown-link-check-disable -->\
[The 11th hour foundation](https://11thhourproject.org/)\
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->.
