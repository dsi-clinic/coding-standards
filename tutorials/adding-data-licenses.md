# Data Licenses

Software repositories often have licenses that cover the code itself, but often neglect any data stored in the repository. You can use the following cases as a guide for deciding what type of data license to add, if any*.

### If your repo has no data or is private
No data license needed

### If your repo has data that owned and licensed by another party
A data license should be added pursuant to the terms set by the owner of the data

### If your repo has data that you own
You can add a data license such as the following, replacing the text surrounded by <> with the relevant information and placing it in a file called DATA-LICENSE at the root of your repository:
